# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

This Java project demonstrates the differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java.

## Key Differences

- **Arrays** have a fixed size and are good for when the number of elements is known in advance.
- **ArrayLists** are more flexible and allow adding or removing elements dynamically.

## What's in the Code

- A simple `String[]` array is created with 3 elements.
- An `ArrayList<String>` is created and elements are added and removed.
- Comments in the code explain each step and key difference.

## Output

The code was successfully run using an online Java compiler.  
See the file `ProgramOutput.png.rtf` for a screenshot showing the printed results.
